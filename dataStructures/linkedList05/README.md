Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

Actual Time to complete: 2 Hours White Board / 5 Hours Coding

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 05, create a Singly Linked List by creating a class. Create three methods; insert, includes, and print.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to reference the linked list and create the required methods. Then test the methods to see if they passed three assertions for each method.

### API
- The insert method takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) time performance.
- The includeds method take any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node's vlaue somewhere within the list.
- The print method takes in no arguments and outputs all sof the current Node values in the Linked List.
