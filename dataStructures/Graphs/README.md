## Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* AddNode()
	* Adds a new node to the graph
	* Takes in the value of that node
	* Returns the added node
* AddEdge()
	* Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
	* Include the ability to have a “weight”
	* Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
	* Both nodes should already be in the Graph
* GetNodes()
	* Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* GetNeighbors()
	* Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
	* Takes in a given node
	* Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
* Size()
	* Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O: Time = O(n)
- Big O: Time = 0(n)
