### Challenge
For Code Challenge 06, create methods that will make inserstions in a linked list.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to use the methods provided and append them to the console by using if conditions and while loops. The Big O approach would be O(n) for time. linked list doesn't grow in memory and already allocates memory for growth so it wouldn't be O(1).
