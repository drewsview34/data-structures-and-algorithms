## Insertion Sort
Insertion is what we call “stable”. A stable sort means that it will keep the original relative order of the input set. A stable sort guarantees that the relative ordering for equivalent values be maintained, while an unstable sort makes no such promises. Both bubble and insertion sort are stable, while selection sort is not.

## Challenge
Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O: Time = O(n)
- Big O: Space = O(1)
