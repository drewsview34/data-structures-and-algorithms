### Stacks And Queues
A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. ... The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

### Challenge
For Stacks And Queues, create three classes; Node, Stack, and Queue. Each class will create methods that reflect common terminology and utlize those methods to display how stacks and queues operate.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to create an array. Then, find the middle of the array and use a for loop to run through the array in the direction towards the search key. Once found, return the index position. If not found, return -1.

### Solution
