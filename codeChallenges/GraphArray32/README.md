## Code Challenge 32

Developer: Andrew Hinojosa

Actual Time to complete: 1 Hours White Board / ??? Hours Coding

# Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.
### Structure and Testing
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
* Ensure your tests are passing.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time = O(n)
Big O Space = O(n)
