Binary Search In A Sorted 1D Array

Actual Time to complete: 2 Hours White Board / 4 Hours Coding

- White board partner: Ray Johnson
- Collaborator: Xia Liu

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 03, Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to create an array. Then, find the middle of the array and use a for loop to run through the array in the direction towards the search key. Once found, return the index position. If not found, return -1.
