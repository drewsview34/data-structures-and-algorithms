### Implement A Queue Using Two Stacks
This challenge utilizes knowledge gain from studying Stacks and Queues.

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 11, Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. The class will implement the standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach is to create queue methods and stack methods. Push the nodes through the input of the first stack, then to the second stack until it is outputed.
For space, it would be O(1) no matter how much we utlize the pop and pop it will always take the same amount of time to complete.
