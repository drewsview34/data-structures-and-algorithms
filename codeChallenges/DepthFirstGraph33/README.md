# Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
### Feature Tasks
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.
### Structure and Testing
* Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
* Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
* Ensure your tests are passing
