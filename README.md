## Code Challenge 02

Insert and shift middle index of array

Actual Time to complete: 2 Hours White Board / 3 Hours Coding

- White board partner: Ray Johnson
- Collaborator: Dez Teague

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 02, I must write a method called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to C# language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to create an array. Then, use a for loop to run through the array to grab each integer in the array and add the a random integer in the middle of the array. The, "Big O," is time and space.
