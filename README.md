## Code Challenge 02

Insert and shift middle index of array

Actual Time to complete: 2 Hours White Board / 3 Hours Coding

- White board partner: Ray Johnson
- Collaborator: Dez Teague

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 02, I must write a method called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to C# language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to create an array. Then, use a for loop to run through the array to grab each integer in the array and add the a random integer in the middle of the array. The, "Big O," is time and space.

## Code Challenge 03

Binary Search In A Sorted 1D Array

Actual Time to complete: 2 Hours White Board / 4 Hours Coding

- White board partner: Ray Johnson
- Collaborator: Deziree Teague

### Challenge
For Code Challenge 03, Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to create an array. Then, find the middle of the array and use a for loop to run through the array in the direction towards the search key. Once found, return the index position. If not found, return -1.
